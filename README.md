Course: LU2IN018 - Advanced C


Description:

This project is a library management system implemented in C, offering two different data structures for storing and managing books:

Linked List → Simple to implement but slower for large datasets.
Hash Table → Optimized for quick searches when well-sized.
The program allows users to add, search, and delete books, while also providing a performance benchmarking tool to compare both data structures.


Content:

This project includes various C programming exercises covering essential concepts in low-level and system programming:

Dynamic memory management

Advanced file handling

Complex data structures (linked lists, hash tables, etc.)

Algorithm efficiency and performance measurement


Additionally, the project features an interactive menu for library management and a benchmarking tool to measure search performance based on dataset size.


Features

Add books to the library

Search by book number, title, or author

Delete books from the system

Find duplicate books (same title & author)

Compare execution times between Linked Lists and Hash Tables

Generate performance graphs using GNUplot
